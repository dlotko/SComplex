<DD>
A PL sphere is a manifold which is PL homeomorphic to the boundary
of a simplex.
It is known that all the spheres in dimensions less than or equal to 3
are PL, but there are non-PL spheres in dimensions larger than or equal
to 5.
The famous way to get non-PL sphere is using Edwards' "double suspension theorem", that is,
if we take a suspension two times over a homology sphere, we have
a manifold homeomorphic to a sphere, but it is not a PL sphere
if the original homology sphere is not a sphere.

<P>
The data given here is made from Bj&ouml;rner and Lutz's
triangulation of the poincar&eacute; sphere by taking double suspension,
according to their paper.
They suggested a way to take a suspension by introducing only one new vertex
in one time ("Datta's trick"), so this non-PL sphere has only 18 vertices.
(With 269 facets.)

<DT>Properties</DT>
<DD>
This sphere is not constructible because all constructible spheres are PL.
This is Cohen-Macaulay because all spheres are Cohen-Macaulay.
