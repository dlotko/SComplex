<H1>Bj&ouml;rner's example of non-extendably shellable 2-polyhedron</H1>

<DL>
<DT>Description</DT>
<DD>
This strange example was made by Bj&ouml;rner.
This is shellable but not extendably shellable.

Identify the vertices with the same labling.
That is, this example is made from a projective plane and one additional
triangle.
</DD>
<DT>Properties</DT>
<DD>
The smallest example which is shellable but not extendably was
found by Moriyama and Takeuchi, with 6 vertices and 9 facets.
That this Bj&ouml;rner's example has non-zero homology and that
it has no boundary should be remarked.
