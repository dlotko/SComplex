# Moriyama-Takeuchi example of a 2-dim simplicial complex.

# taken from:
#  Sonoko Moriyama, "Extendable shellability in dimension two",
#  Bachelor's thesis, University of Tokyo, 2000.
# and
#  Sonoko Moriyama and Fumihiko Takeuchi, "Incremental construction
#    properties in dimension two --- shellability, extendable shellability
#    and vertex decomposability", preprint.
#
# Remark: This is the same as the example by A.Bjorner:
#  Andreas Bjorner, "The homology and shellability of matroids and
#    geometric lattices", in Matroid Applications, N.White ed.,
#    Cambridge Univ.Press, 1992, 226-283. (Exercise 7.37)
