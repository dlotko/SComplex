Lickorish (1991) showed the there are non-shellable
triangulations of a 3-sphere.
What he showed is the fact that if a triangulation of a 3-sphere
contain a knot made of 3 edges in the 1-skeleton, then it is
not shellable.
What he suggested to make such a triangulation is to use the
following construction.

First, we prepare the <A href="knot_eng.html">Furch's 3-ball</A>
with a knotted spanning arc consisting of one edge.
Then we take a cone over the boundary of the ball, then we have
a triangulated 3-sphere with a knot made of 3 edges.

The data given here is made from <A href="knot.html">knot.dat</A>
by one-point compactification. This has 381vertices and 1928 facets.

Lickorish's original theorem asserts that the triangulation is
non-shellable if the knot embedded is "complex enough",
but in fact, it is not shellable (even not constructible)
if the knot is nontrivial.
