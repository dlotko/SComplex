# R.S.Simon's example of shellable 2-complex
# whose shelling ends at a unique facet ("4 5 6").
#
# taken from:
#   Robert Samuel Simon,
#   Combinatorial Properties of "Cleanness",
#   J.Algebra, 167(1994), 361-388.
#
# This example is contractible but its boundary is
# made of only one edge "4 5". This implies that
# the unique facet "4 5 6" which contain "4 5" is
# the last facet in every shelling.
