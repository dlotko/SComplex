<DT>Description</DT>
<DD>
A famous example of a triangulation of a 3-ball, made by Bing.
The two-dimensional version of this example (the left figure)
is a very famous 2-polyhedron which is non-collapsible but contractible.
<CENTER><IMG src="bing.gif" width=613 height=328></CENTER>
The object in the left figure is made by two-dimensional panels,
with two rooms.
The upper room is to be entered from the bottom face, and the lower room
is to be entered from the upper face.
(The two small pannels attached to the tunnels make this object
 to be contractible.)
<P>
If we replace every two-dim pannels by a one-layered pile of cubes
and triangulate each cube into six tetrahedra (as in the right figure)
we get a triangulated 3-ball and it is not shellable.
<P>
The data given here has 480 vertices and 1554 facets.

<DD>
This is known as a non-shellable triangulation of a 3-ball, but
in fact this is not constructible, either.
